# Perceptron
Perceptron algorithm for binary classification data


Both data (sonar and bankote - authentication) can be downloaded from site: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php
To test the performance of Perceptron's algorithm i splited data with cross validation algorithm to create data for training the weights and test it.
In code line 105-106 you can choose which data you want to run (sonar or bank) by uncomment and comment one of this lines.
Code is adequately commented.
